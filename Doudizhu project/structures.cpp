Card card[55];   //54 cards from index of 1 to 54   card=deck   ps: Later I realised that card this name was not good, I wanted to change it into deck, but unfortunately this is a global variable, I have to change any position that uses this variable to achieve the purpose, and it will take a long time, so I gave it up.
Player player[4];   //3 players from index 1 to 3
